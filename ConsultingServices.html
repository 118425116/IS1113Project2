            <h3>Blockchain</h3>
            
            <p>Blockchain is an advanced way of logging and protecting data and changes to a decentralised database that makes it impossible to change or hack. It's the technology
                <br>
                that underpins digital currencies, such as Bitcoin, helping to protect against  double-spending and hyperinflation in banking, and helping achieve automated supply
                <br>
                chain management in manufacturing. Blockchain is one of the most advanced technologies around, mainly because it has to do so many things at once too ensure that
                <br>
                wherever the information resides, it's correct and everyone can see the same information.

            <h3>Autonomous Things</h3>
            <img src='autonomous.jpg' alt='Autonomous' align='right' style='width:320px;height:190px;'>
            <p>This is a term for the technological developments that are expected to bring computers into the physical environment as autonomous entities without human direction,
                <br>
                freely moving and interacting with humans and other objects. For example autonomous cars do not need a driver. They drive themselves by collecting data from their 
                <br>
                environment; such as the road conditions, potential hazards, pedestrians, surrounding vehicles and even storing the routes and roads themselves. In order for these
                <br>
                vehicles to become safer they rely on a vast amounts of software and the collection of vast amounts of data to train the artificial intelligence to ensure the safety
                <br>
                of their passengers without humans having to intervene. Some believe that this technology is the future, but is this a good thing?
                <br>
                In my opinion it's not. Humans must have control over the technology, not the other way around.</p>

            <h3>Immersive Experience</h3>
            <img src='immersive.jpg' alt='Autonomous' align='right' style='width:320px;height:190px;'>
            <p>Immersive Experience relates to technology that augments reality and changes how people react with
                each other, both in the digital and physical world. Augmented reality, mixed reality and virtual
                reality are three widely known formats that create an immersive experience.
                <br>
                Immersive technologies have the capability to bring people together from faraway places and experience
                moments together. It can help promote brand awareness and be used to test prototypes before they are even built,
                or to try out high end or heavy items before being purchased.
